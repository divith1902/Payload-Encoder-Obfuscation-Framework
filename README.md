# Payload-Encoder-Obfuscation-Framework
Cybersecurity internship project demonstrating payload encoding, obfuscation, and signature-based detection.

# Custom Payload Encoder & Obfuscation Framework

## Description
This project demonstrates how payload encoding and obfuscation techniques
can bypass simple signature-based detection mechanisms.

The project is developed as part of a cybersecurity internship
for educational and ethical purposes only.

## Features
- Base64 Encoding
- XOR Encoding with user-defined key
- ROT13 Encoding
- String Obfuscation
- Signature-based Detection Simulation

## Technologies Used
- Python
- base64 module
- codecs module

## Workflow
1. User inputs payload from console
2. Payload is encoded (Base64 / XOR / ROT13)
3. Encoded payload is obfuscated
4. Signature-based detection is tested
5. Results are displayed

## Output
- Original payload: Detected
- Encoded payloads: Not Detected
- Obfuscated payload: Not Detected

## Disclaimer
This project is created only for learning and demonstration purposes.
It does not target any real systems.
